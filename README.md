# Decompiler-SoK

## Tools

This section introduces decompilers currently available to users.
Some of them are commonly used in reverse engineering pratice, for example, **Ghidra**, **JEB**, and **Hex-Rays**.
Others are not yet complete. Some are still under development.
The readers can try out each tool at dogbolt.org.
